    "text": "Hello! My name is Christopher Lawrence. I’m a PhD candidate at the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC) at the University of Albany. I am currently assisting the Lance Lab with the cloud water monitoring site at the summit of Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondack Mountains. I use observations and modeling techniques to investigate the role of cloud chemical processing on organic carbon in the aqueous and particle phases, and how they interact with other inorganic species. My research interests include biogeochemistry of organic carbon (particularly in the atmospheric aqueous phase), organic carbon and nitrogen interactions, wet deposition, the carbon cycle, and statistics."

    "text": "I help assist the cloud water monitoring program at the summit of Whiteface Mountain that has been operating since 1994. The site was founded to monitor acid deposition and the progress of the Clean Air Act Amendments of the 1990s. Acid deposition is cause by the formation for strong inorganic acids such has sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). In particular, sulfuric acid largely produced from sulfur dioxide (SO2) , a gas released from the combustion of coal. Thanks to regulation, acid deposition has decreased signficantly and Adirondack ecosystems are starting to show signs of recovery. However, another class of compounds may be on the rise: organic carbon. Organic carbon is a complex class of molecules that are the fundamental building blocks of life. As sulfuric acid and nitric acid have decreased, organic carbon is making a larger fraction of particulate matter."
